[Sovereign's Domination]
INNATE - Dominator's Grasp: Whenever Viego scores an enemy champion takedown while alive and within 3 seconds of damaging them, a Mist Wraith spawns from that champion's corpse for 8 seconds. Viego can basic attack or Spectral Maw a Mist Wraith to consume it: causing him to blink to its location after winding up for 2 seconds, during which he heals himself for 1% (+ 5% per 100 bonus AD) (+ 3% per 100 AP) (+ 7% per 100% bonus attack speed) of the target's maximum health over the duration, gains 40 / 55 / 70% (based on level) + (10% per 100 bonus AD) damage reduction (halved against towers), immunity to crowd control effects, and unable to act.  He then gains Possession.

POSSESSION: For 10 seconds, Viego assumes the enemy champion's form and gains their basic attacks, basic abilities, items, and base stats (based on Viego's level). He also gains a free cast of Ruination which deals half the damage, scales with the possession's health, and is initially placed on a 1.5-second cooldown, and 10% bonus movement speed while facing an enemy champion within 2500 units.

Viego cannot use item actives item actives, consumable items, nor the shop during Possession. Casting Ruination or attacking a Mist Wraith ends Possession immediately.

Viego will preserve his current health percentage between transformations.

INNATE - THE BLACK MIST: Viego's abilities create black mist. While Viego is in black mist, he gains 25 / 30 / 35 / 40 / 45 / 50% (based on the rank of Blade of the Ruined King) bonus attack speed, 7.5 / 10 / 12.5 / 15 / 17.5 / 20 (+ 5 per 100 bonus AD) (based on the rank of Harrowed Mist) bonus armor and magic resistance, and 10 / 15 / 20 / 25 / 30 / 30% (+ 4% per 100 AP)(based on the rank of Harrowed Mist) movement speed (increased to 20 / 25 / 30 / 35 / 40 / 45 towards enemy champions within 2500 units).



[Blade of the Ruined King]
COOLDOWN: 5 / 4.5 / 4 / 3.5 / 3
PASSIVE: The black mist's bonus attack speed is increased.

BONUS ATTACK SPEED:
30 / 35 / 40 / 45 / 50%

PASSIVE: Viego's basic attacks are empowered to deal bonus physical damage on-hit, which has a minimum threshold and is capped at 80 against monsters.

BONUS PHYSICAL DAMAGE:
2 / 2.5 / 3 / 3.5 / 4% (+ 2 / 2.25 / 2.5 / 2.75 / 3% per 100 bonus AD) of target's current health
MINIMUM BONUS DAMAGE:
10 / 15 / 20 / 25 / 30
Additionally, his damaging abilities apply a mark to enemies hit for 4 seconds. Viego's next basic attack against a marked target is empowered to consume the mark on-hit to strike a second time, dealing 20% AD (+ 15% AP) physical damage and healing him for 135% of the post-mitigation damage dealt, increased to 145% against monsters and reduced to 10% against minions.

The second strike can critically strike for 35% (+ 7%) AD (+ 26.25% (+ 5.25%) AP) physical damage and applies on-hit effects at 100% effectiveness.

ACTIVE: Viego stabs in a line in the target direction that deals physical damage to enemies hit, increased by 0% − 100% (based on critical strike chance), and 20 bonus physical damage against monsters.

PHYSICAL DAMAGE:»
15 / 30 / 45 / 60 / 75 (+ 70% AD)
 × (1 + (100% + 0% 0%) critical strike chance)
Blade of the Ruined King's passive remains under Possession Possession, and while transformed, the second strike is instead converted to bonus damage on-hit which no longer applies on-hit effects but can still critically strike (based on possessed stats).

[Spectral Maw]
COOLDOWN: 10 / 9 / 8 / 7 / 6

ACTIVE: Viego charges while being slowed by 10% for up to 3 seconds to increase Spectral Maw's missile range and slow duration over the first second of the channel.

Spectral Maw can be recast within the duration and automatically cancels afterwards. If the charge is interrupted, Spectral Maw is put on a 3-second cooldown.

RECAST: Viego hurls a blast of mist in the target direction and dashes a fixed distance in the same direction, though not through terrain. The mist deals magic damage to the first enemy hit, and slows them by 50 / 55 / 60 / 65 / 70% for 0.5 − 1.25 (based on channel time) seconds.

If an enemy champion is hit by the blast, they leave behind a trail of mist where they walk, which lasts 8 seconds.

If the blast is sent through black mist, it travels through the entire distance of the black mist as bonus range.

MAGIC DAMAGE:
80 / 135 / 190 / 245 / 300 (+ 100% AP)
Spectral Maw resets Viego's basic attack timer. Viego can cast any of his abilities during the dash.

[Harrowed Path]
COOLDOWN: 14 / 12 / 10 / 8 / 6
PASSIVE: The black mist's bonus armor, magic resist, and movement speed is increased.

BONUS ARMOR AND MAGIC RESIST:
10 / 12.5 / 15 / 17.5 / 20 (+ 5 per 100 bonus AD)

BONUS MOVEMENT SPEED:
15 / 20 / 25 / 30 / 30% (+ 4% per 100 AP)

ACTIVE: Viego sends a spectre in the target direction that creates a trail of black mist in its wake which lasts 8 seconds. If it hits terrain, the mist will spread further around either side.

During this time, black mist also grants Viego camouflage.


Declaring a basic attack or casting an ability will break the camouflage and remove the bonus movement speed, preventing Viego from gaining them again for 1 second, reduced to 0.6 seconds if he recasted Spectral Maw and increased to 2 seconds if he attacked a monster. This duration refreshes on subsequent attacks and ability casts.

Harrowed Path can be cast during any of Viego's abilities. He cannot gain the camouflage nor bonus movement speed from Harrowed Path for 0.75 seconds after starting the channel of Spectral Maw, recasting ends this duration prematurely.

[Ruination]
COST: 5% (+ 10% per 100 bonus AD) CURRENT HEALTH
COOLDOWN: 120 / 110 / 100
PASSIVE: Whenever Viego scores an enemy champion takedown while alive and within 3 seconds of damaging them, a bloom of black mist spawns around that champion's corpse, which lasts 8 seconds.
ACTIVE: Viego stabs his heart with his blade, dealing damage to himself and nearby enemies, and causing black mist to spawn outward from himself. He then assumes his role as the ruined king for 10 seconds.
During this time the bonus on hit damage from Blade of the Ruined King is dealt as maximum health damage, the armor and magic resistance in the black mist is doubled, possession channel time is halved, enemies inside black mist are marked by Blade of the Ruined King, and enemies in the black mist are bonus dealt magic damage per second.

The duration of the ruined king is refreshed when Viego scores a takedown.

BONUS PHYSICAL DAMAGE:
100 / 150 / 200 (+ 5% (+ 10% per 100 bonus AD) maximum health)
BONUS MAGIC DAMAGE PER SECOND:
0.5 / 0.75 / 1% (+ 1% per 100 bonus AD) of their maximum health

If a Possession is discarded, Ruination will be placed on a 1.5-second cooldown if it is not already on cooldown.
