	Zephyr goes into a frenzy, doubling and uncapping his attack speed and gaining and additional (15 / 20 / 25 / 30 / 35)% attack speed for 5 seconds, during this time his attacks deal 66% less damage, apply on hit effects at 33% effectiveness, and cause his 
	attacks to convert (15 / 17.5 / 20 / 22.5 / 25)% of damage they deal into a rapidly decaying shield.

	[Codependency]
	Cooldown - 120 / 110 / 100

	During this time, Zephyr enters a frenzy, gaining (10 / 15 / 20%) movement speed, (10 / 20 / 30) ability haste, and (20 / 40 / 60%) attack speed.
	Whenever Zephyr deals damage to an enemy champion, he gains a stack of momentum, momentum does not have a cap and stacks decay at a faster rate the more he has.
	Every stack of momentum increases the duration of [Codependency] by (2 / 3 / 4) seconds, as well as giving him (2 / 4 / 6%) movement speed, (4 / 8 / 12%) attack speed, and (4 / 5 / 6) ability haste.
	The duration is only further increased for every stack beyond the set cap.
	Higher momentum stacks have diminishing returns, down to a minimum of (0.2 / 0.3 / 0.4) seconds, (0.2 / 0.3 / 0.4%) movement speed, (0.4 / 0.8 / 1.2%) attack speed, and (0.4 / 0.5 / 0.6) ability haste.
	Casting [Take Flight] pauses the duration of [Codependency] while it lasts.

	grants untargettability during this time.
	
	[The Best Defense]
